# SAT Scores and Educational Equity

The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States.  The SAT covers critical reading, mathematics, and writing, and scores range from 400 to 1600.The dataset we will be exploring contains SAT scores from various states across the country, including the average total SAT scores for each state, as well as the scores for the individual sections. Additionally, the dataset includes demographic information about test-takers, such as gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Measuring and analyzing these factors enable us to investigate potential disparities in SAT performance.

How a student performs on the SAT can tremendously impact their future. Understanding the patterns in scores in light of geographical and demographical information can help identify where more academic support is needed. Affirmative action continues to be a contentious topic in today's college admission process, especially after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action. Affirmative action seeks to increase representation of underrepresented groups and promote diversity. Examining this dataset can also set the stage for future exploration of the potential educational and career outcomes of affirmative action.

Some questions that I hope to investigate through this project are:
1. How do states with different educational policies and funding levels perform on the SAT? 
2. Are there any correlations between SAT scores and demographic/geographic factors? 

The dataset can be accessed at this link: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/school_scores/. Discussions about missing data and gaps in the narrative are further discussed in the Discussion section. 

The key findings from this study were
1. In the case document of the Supreme Court's ban of affirmative action, the most common negative words were "no", "limited" and "argued". The most common positive words were "Fair", "Justice" and "United". Other frequent words made nods to history thus it is important to consider historical perspective in discussions related to affirmative action.
2. There was barely any variance in performance between income groups despite most test takers being in 100k+ income brackets. This may be attributed to taking a sample size of mainly high-performing students.
